# Financial Inclusion & Digital Payment Adoption in Asia  
**Bangladesh’s Progress vs. High-Performing Asian Economies (2014–2021)**

An empirical comparison of Bangladesh with Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong SAR (China), and Malaysia.

### Overview

This Jupyter notebook analyzes **financial inclusion**, **digital payment adoption**, and **gender gaps** in account ownership using **Global Findex Database** (2014, 2017, 2021) and **World Development Indicators** data.  

It compares Bangladesh — an emerging economy with rapid mobile money growth — against four high-performing Asian benchmarks with commendable inclusion.

### Core Objective

Investigate whether **internet penetration** and **GDP per capita** drive higher **digital payment usage**, which in turn contributes to **closing gender gaps** in financial inclusion in Bangladesh compared to regional leaders as of 2021.

### Research Questions

1. Does **GDP per capita** significantly drive digital payment usage?  
2. Does **internet penetration** explain variation in digital payment adoption?  
3. Is digital payment adoption associated with reduced **gender gaps** in account ownership?

### Key Findings

- **RQ1**: GDP shows only weak, non-significant association (r = 0.284, p = 0.5247 cluster-robust).  
- **RQ2**: Internet penetration is a significant driver (r = 0.522, p = 0.0217 cluster-robust).  
- **RQ3**: Digital payments negatively linked to gender gaps (r = -0.463, p = 0.0770 cluster-robust) — directionally supportive but not significant at 5%.  
- **Multivariate**: Internet remains the strongest predictor of gender gap reduction after controls.  
- **Bangladesh**: Digital payments rose from ~3% to ~29%; gender gaps narrowed — driven by mobile money (bKash, Nagad), policy, and leapfrogging.

### Policy Implications

- Scale women-inclusive mobile money and agent networks to close remaining gender gaps.
- Invest in affordable internet and broadband to amplify digital payment growth.
- Strengthen interoperability, low/no-fee transactions, and G2P payments via digital channels.
- Promote financial literacy targeted at underserved groups (rural women, low-income households).

### Limitations

- Small sample size (15 observations) limits statistical power.
- Correlation ≠ causation; unobserved factors may influence results.
- Data up to 2021; post-COVID developments not captured.
